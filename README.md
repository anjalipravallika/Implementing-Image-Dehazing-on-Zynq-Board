# Implementing-Image-Dehazing-on-Zynq-Board

Image Dehazing is a technique used to enhance a video or image which has been degraded visibility because of environmental conditions. This causes many serious problems in real life, example, there are many train accidents noted because of these hazed images being used for operation, So we have found a method to implement dehazing on Zynq FPGA Board.
